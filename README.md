# INVESTMENT-GUIDE-IN-STOCK-MARKET

# Stock Market Analysis using Machine Learning in Jupyter

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing stock market data using machine learning techniques to predict future trends and risks. We implement models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Time Series Analysis** to forecast stock prices and evaluate the risk-return profiles of various stocks. We also analyze volatility to provide insights into market behavior.

## Features

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple approach to model the relationship between time and stock prices.
2. **Volatility Analysis**: Analyzing the degree of variation in stock price over time to assess risk.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Utilizing models such as ARIMA for forecasting stock price trends based on historical data.
4. **Risk vs Return Prediction**: Analysis of risk and return metrics to make informed investment decisions.
5. **Random Forest**: A machine learning model that leverages multiple decision trees for improved accuracy in stock price prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Data Sources

You can use any stock market data in CSV format, or retrieve real-time data using the `yfinance` package.

Example to retrieve stock data:

```python
import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
data.to_csv('data/apple_stock.csv')
```

## Analysis Steps

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - We use linear regression to model the relationship between stock price and time.
   - You can find the implementation in `notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb`.

### 2. **Volatility Analysis**
   - Calculate volatility based on stock price changes and analyze risk.
   - Implementation is available in `notebooks/volatility_analysis.ipynb`.

### 3. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - We employ ARIMA/SARIMA models for predicting stock prices based on historical data.
   - Find the notebook in `notebooks/time_series_forecasting.ipynb`.

### 4. **Risk vs Return Prediction**
   - Analyze the historical risk and return of selected stocks to provide a decision-making framework.
   - Refer to `notebooks/risk_vs_return.ipynb`.

### 5. **Random Forest Prediction**
   - Random Forest is used to predict stock prices based on various stock features.
   - Check `notebooks/random_forest_prediction.ipynb` for implementation.

## Results

- **Linear Regression**: Shows basic trends in stock prices over time, but may not capture more complex relationships.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Helps in understanding the risk associated with the stock’s price movement.
- **Time Series**: ARIMA model captures patterns and seasonality, useful for short-term forecasts.
- **Risk vs Return**: Provides insights on the balance between the stock’s potential rewards and the risks involved.
- **Random Forest**: A more complex model that handles multiple features to improve prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing stock market data using various machine learning models. The results can help in making better investment decisions and understanding stock market behavior.
